# REST API Demo Project

This is a project to demonstrate a REST API implemented in Node.js.
This project helped clarify and strengthen my concepts regarding RESTful APIs and MongoDB.

The technologies and libraries I used are as follows:

-   Node.js
-   MongoDB
-   Express
-   Mongoose
-   dotenv

I used Express as a framework to create the server side application for this project.

MongoDB was the database of choice due to it being simple to understand and relations were not really needed in this project.

Mongoose is a library to help make working with our MongoDB database from our application much easier. Mongoose has great fucntionality to create schemas and models for the data we need to store.

Finally, the dotenv library helped me to create environment variables to store my Database Connection URL safely and can be further used to ensure API keys and other private keys remain private to us.
